/**
 * A Marmot information store.
 * <p>
 * Objects stored in a repository are <dfn>resources</dfn>. Certain resources called <dfn>collections</dfn> have a parent/child relationship with other
 * resources; otherwise they are treated like other resources. There are no special methods for working with collection resources; rather, collections are
 * identified by an ending {@link URIs#PATH_SEPARATOR} character.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A repository has the concept of a <dfn>live property</dfn> which is dynamically set based upon resource state, such as content size and last modified
 * date/time. Live properties are definitionally inherent to the makeup of the resource. Live properties cannot be set using normal property manipulation
 * methods and are ignored if requested to be modified. See {@link #getLivePropertyURIs()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By design a repository has no direct method for explicitly and exclusively setting all properties of a resource. Instead, resources can have individual
 * properties added, removed, and set. This allows a loosely-coupled model that can be implemented by a variety of storage mechanisms and prevents inadvertent
 * removal of unmentioned properties. If it is required to exclusively specify all properties of a resource, the properties of a resource may be retrieved and
 * the unwanted properties explicitly removed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@value Content#MODIFIED_PROPERTY_URI} property is <em>not</em> considered a live property; it is completely managed by Marmot. This is because the last
 * modification of the content, represented by this property, is distinct from the last modification of the underlying file store. However, this property does
 * have some peculiarities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When reading a resource <em>description</em>, if no {@value Content#MODIFIED_PROPERTY_URI} property exists the repository implementation may use the
 * modified value of the underlying file store if present.</li>
 * <li>When writing resource <em>content</em>, if no {@value Content#MODIFIED_PROPERTY_URI} is given in the provided description, a new property will be
 * automatically added with the current date and time for the API methods that do not have a description parameter.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Collections should indicated a {@value Content#LENGTH_PROPERTY_URI} of zero unless the collection has content. A content length should never be missing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Repositories that are read-only should throw {@link ResourceForbiddenException}s for accesses that attempt to modify resources.
 * </p>
